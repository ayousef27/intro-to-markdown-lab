# How to Write an HTML Boilerplate

An HTML boilerplate is a basic structure that serves as a starting point for building a web page. It includes essential elements like the `DOCTYPE`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags, providing a foundation for any HTML page.

## 1. Basic HTML Boilerplate Structure

Every HTML document starts with the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration. This tells the browser which version of HTML the page is written in. The boilerplate also includes a root `<html>` element, a `<head>` section for metadata, and a `<body>` section for the content of the page.

### Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to your HTML boilerplate!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
